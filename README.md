Information Theory - Practical Assignment
---

In this assignment, we have made a deep study about the **information transfer** and **mutual information** between two **neurons** (each one represented by a time series). To achieve this, we have firstly created a **representation** of the (discretized) signal, using a fixed window size. To find this optimal window size, we have studied which would be the best possible case. Afer this, we compute the previously mentioned measures using different **word sizes**. Lastly, we hav used **SAX representation** of the signal to compute the same quantities that had been obtained using our hand-crafted representation.
